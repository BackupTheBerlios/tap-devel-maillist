<PRE>Cheers for the info Robin,
 
Not sure I am up to disassembling the code, but I think I will follow your
suggestion of finding alternate random generation instead. Unfortunately
using rand() on its own also causes a crash.

Subject: Re: [TAP-devel] Use of srand(), rand()
 
If you wan't to work out how the compiler has broken it I'd suggest creating
a TAP that does this (and only this) in its tap main, compile it both ways
and run 'mips-objdump -d' (dissassemble) on the .elf files and see how they
differ. I'd guess the problem lies in the implementation of srand in libc,
not in the call to it. I'd even go so far as to speculate that it might be
an integer overflow exception (MIPS has 2 types of arithmetic functions, one
sort throws exceptions on overflow and the other doesnt - maybe the new
compiler is using the wrong one?).

If you just want random numbers, don't worry about srand(), just call rand()
and xor the results with something like the current MJD and the current tick
count. Alternatively you can probably find rand/srand implementations on the
web and try coding your own to see if that fares any better.

Hi guys,
 
When I call the srand() function 
 
e.g. srand(TAP_GetTick());
 
it crashes the Toppy. This function appears to work ok when compiled using
the original Topfield supplied gcc.
 
Anyone got any ideas as to why this would be?
 
Cheers,
 
Mark
