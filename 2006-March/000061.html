<PRE>Hi Mark,

Sorry to hear you're having trouble. I'm afraid I can offer little help with
your toolchain problems. I had enough trouble getting the correct bits of
Cygwin up and running! Given the small number of people actively
contributing to Berlios, documentation has unfortunately not been a
priority. I'd hope that in this absence some of the TAPs might serve as a
starting point for new development. However, if they don't build we're going
to need a little help from you to sort it out. Obviously people wouldn't put
unbuildable code into svn on purpose so all the issues are likely to be due
to Windows v. Unix. Us Windows users just don't have any way of testing for
Unix compatibility unless someone knows otherwise. Do you have a list of the
TAPs that don't build and which files are causing problems? I've found
makefiles are like stepping back into the dark ages after using development
environments to manage builds for 11 years!

Simon

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You mean a self-inflicted mixup? I just download the toolchain and type

</I>&gt;<i> environment issue between my recent Debian (x86) and what the toolchain
</I>&gt;<i> expects and certainly cygwin will be quite different (in versions at
</I>&gt;<i> least) to my environment.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Try building one of the test taps from berlios and see if your
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; toolchain is actually OK. The binaries should have been built to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; /usr/local/topfield-gcc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I already did some successfully so (I think?) my toolchain will build
</I>&gt;<i> all taps ok. However, I was looking for complete confidence by seeing
</I>&gt;<i> the toolchain make complete properly and the formal tap tests succeed. I
</I>&gt;<i> guess I will give up on this but a bug in the toolchain build does
</I>&gt;<i> exist.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> BTW, regarding the svn tree. The make only succeeds for 8 of the 12 taps
</I>&gt;<i> and only libutils amongst the 6 libs. However, the errors are mostly due
</I>&gt;<i> to mistakes in the Makefiles, filename case errors, dos file names (e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> include .\tapstring), missing files, and plenty of other errors I can't
</I>&gt;<i> determine. Most of the source files have very odd line terminations (not
</I>&gt;<i> just a unix/dos issue), e.g. CRLF + LF (but not consistently in the same
</I>&gt;<i> file?). Do nearly all of the contributors here work on Windows and what
</I>&gt;<i> editors are they using? There are also directories in the libs area with
</I>&gt;<i> plenty of source files but no explanation of what the lib does or how to
</I>&gt;<i> build or use it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please don't take this comment harshly because this facility is a good
</I>&gt;<i> idea and has great potential. Clearly a number of people have gone to
</I>&gt;<i> enormous effort to set up and contribute to this community effort. These
</I>&gt;<i> (minor?) issues do make it onerous for a newbie however.
