You mean a self-inflicted mixup? I just download the toolchain and type
make don't I? I haven't changed anything. The problem will likely be an
environment issue between my recent Debian (x86) and what the toolchain
expects and certainly cygwin will be quite different (in versions at
least) to my environment.

&gt;<i> Try building one of the test taps from berlios and see if your
</I>&gt;<i> toolchain is actually OK. The binaries should have been built to
</I>&gt;<i> /usr/local/topfield-gcc.
</I>
I already did some successfully so (I think?) my toolchain will build
all taps ok. However, I was looking for complete confidence by seeing
the toolchain make complete properly and the formal tap tests succeed. I
guess I will give up on this but a bug in the toolchain build does
exist.

BTW, regarding the svn tree. The make only succeeds for 8 of the 12 taps
and only libutils amongst the 6 libs. However, the errors are mostly due
to mistakes in the Makefiles, filename case errors, dos file names (e.g.
include .\tapstring), missing files, and plenty of other errors I can't
determine. Most of the source files have very odd line terminations (not
just a unix/dos issue), e.g. CRLF + LF (but not consistently in the same
file?). Do nearly all of the contributors here work on Windows and what
editors are they using? There are also directories in the libs area with
plenty of source files but no explanation of what the lib does or how to
build or use it.

Please don't take this comment harshly because this facility is a good
idea and has great potential. Clearly a number of people have gone to
enormous effort to set up and contribute to this community effort. These
(minor?) issues do make it onerous for a newbie however.
