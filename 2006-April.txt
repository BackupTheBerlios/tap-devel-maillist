Hi experts,
I was hoping to compile TAPcommander on berlios but I'm not sure how
much time I'll have to invest.
I followed the installation instructions and verified that
freespacebar compiled (it did).

However with tapcomander I first had to manually create tap.c and now
I get the error

make: /usr/local/topfield-gcc/bin/mips-g++: Command not found
make: *** [TAPCommander.o] Error 127]

when I execute the build.

Have I taken on more than I can chew  :roll:  or is there a simple explanation?
Thanks,
Alan

Tap commander uses C++ and the compiler isn't in the standard toolchain
that you download from berlios. You need to rebuild the toolchain with
c++ enabled - rough instructions are here :

I'm not an expert (I've not yet written a line of TAP code yet) but I
did download and install the C++ toolchain recently, see my posts from
last months list archive. All the necessary C++ toolchain changes exist
in svn so just checkout the toolchain directory, type make and make
install, and you should have the C++ toolchain built up in
/usr/local/topfield-gcc/. It just appears nobody has yet gotten around
to bundling up this latest toolchain into the pre-built file download on
berlios?

Are you using a linux environment? Or cygwin/windows? Since most of the
developers here seem to use cygwin then if you are on linux you will
find quite a few make errors (see my posts last month) but most (all?)
of them can hacked around relatively easily. I just did a make in the
tapcommander directory and even though I have the C++ compiler
installed, it tripped up over many other problems which I did not bother
to pursue. Good luck.

Hi Robin,
Thanks very much for replying.

I tried this but failed. Here are the results (to be honest it's two 
months ago that I initially installed the gcc environment and I can't 
remember now how I did it - other than to follow the instructions on 
toppy.co.org).:

After downloading  the 1.1.tar.gz file this is what I did this morning.

1.> The gcc directories existed already so I renamed them.
2. > Extracted but couldn't find cccp.c mentioned on xwiki

3.> Couldn't find any reference to enable-language anywhere.

4.> Ran the routine to fix libtap.a and replaced it.

Unfortunately I still get the same error (I wonder if it's just a path 
thing). I also noticed that mips-g++.exe exists in three directories

\usr\bin
\usr\local\bin
\usr\gcc_for_tap\local\bin

but they're all the same size and date (23.05.2003 14:46)

Any ideas?

Alan 
PS: I know C but not c++ (but I can read the code) and not this 
development environment as you can see)

Hi Mark, Robin,

Thanks  for your response. I am using cygwin windows but, for example,
I don't even know in which directory I should run the make and make
install and then I'll have to solve the TAPcommander compile issues.
And then there's the matter of grappling with c++ when I only know C.

My only interest was producing a slightly modified tap but I now
realise that I am out of my depth.

So please forgive me if I gracefully retire from this and thank you
again for all your help,

Alan
