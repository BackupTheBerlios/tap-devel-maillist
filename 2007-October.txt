Subject: [TAP-devel] problem with checking out project
Message-ID: <568113.53717.qm@web84005.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi,
   I am a new user and I'm having issues checking out
the tap project, because I'm behind a firewall that I
can't change.  Is there any way that I could get a
secure login so that I can use
https://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/tap/trunk instead
of http:
    If not, is there any other way that I can download
the project instead of doing a checkout?
    Thank you in advance,
        Kristina
