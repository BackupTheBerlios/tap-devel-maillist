<PRE>The TAP project has had a few contributions recently and the SVN 
repository now has some code that is probably ready for release. I would 
like to encourage individual authors to make use of the BerliOS 
facilities and prepare file releases for their work. This will help both 
the end users and the TAP project. End users will have easy access to 
released product and the TAP project will have wider acceptance because 
there are usable downloads.

The file release process is fairly simple. At a bare minimum you have to 
compile the source code and package it into a downloadable file (.tar.gz 
or .zip are good candidates). You can prepare a multi-file release if 
you wish, for example one file with source code, another with TAP and 
related files and a third one with client application to be installed on 
a PC.

Ensure that the downloadable files have a unique file name. For example, 
MyTAP_1.3.zip is good, but MyTAP.zip isn't suitable.

Upload the file(s) anonymously with FTP to 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.berlios.de/incoming/">ftp://ftp.berlios.de/incoming/</A> - do not forget to use binary mode.

If this is the first time you are releasing a package, send an email to 
the tap-devel list advising of the uploaded filename and what 
package/release these files form. I will create the required setup on 
the backend for the file release and make the files available.

If this is a subsequent revision of a package already released (or if 
you are familiar with the file release process), you can use the BerliOS 
file release mechanisms to create and release new packages/revisions 
your self. The Quick-Release File process may be suitable for releasing 
version updates of existing packages.

As always, if there are any questions or suggestions, please feel free 
to post them to the mailing list.

</PRE>
