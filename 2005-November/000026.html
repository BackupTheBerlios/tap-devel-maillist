<PRE>Did all those new/delete problems disappear too?

I have a prototype CommonUI library in progress as a proof of concept
that the UK/OZ components can be factored out easily that I was going
to check in to berlios last night, but ran out of time. So far I've
got it supporting the keyboard screen (minus flashing caret) and
yesnobox and have a demo TAP that uses it. I'd like to take this
further as a sort of generic TAP framework with TSRCommander and
RemoteExtender support built in, but C was getting my brain tied in
knots. I'd be interested in comparing our architectures - mine was
thrown together last night in an hour or so and isn't entirely worthy
of the architecture title!

BTW Kriptic produced an example messagebox class which is worth a
look. See <A HREF="http://web.aanet.com.au/kriptic/TAPs">http://web.aanet.com.au/kriptic/TAPs</A>

@Peter:
Another Berlios question, where is the best place to put work that you
know is going to have a limited lifespan? This would be good for
demoing prototypes of TAPs and libraries.
