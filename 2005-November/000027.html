<PRE>I still have custom new/delete functions in my test class - not tried
taking them out to being global overrides yet, or putting back the
templatized base class that provided them automatically. I'm fairly
confident that the template, at least, will work.

I tried a global class and the constructor isn't called on tap load -
the memory of the object does seem to be initialized to zero though. You
can work around this with a singleton pattern if needed where you
construct the object on first access instead. Freeing up resources on
tap exit of the singleton would need to be attended to though.

I found the vtable (gcc seems to put the pointer to it at the end of the
object, whereas msvc puts it at the start). Looks like the problem is
that the function addresses in the vtable aren't being offset by the tap
base adress. If that's the only problem it should be possible to write
some code to fix them up inside TAP_Main. The format of the vtable seems
to be

word 0   // preamble - probably not always zeros for inheritance or
virtual/multiple inheritance
word 0
dword 0 // end of preamble

word 0   // offsets for this pointer for 1st virtual method
word 0
dword &amp;first_virtualmethod
word 0   // offsets for this pointer for 2nd virtual method
word 0
dword &amp;second_virtualmethod
...
dword 0 // zeros at the end terminate the list?
dword 0

So there's 8 bytes at the beginning to leave alone, then 8 bytes per
method needing adjustment in the second dword until you hit 8 bytes that
are all zero.

The last 4 bytes of the object itself are a pointer to this structure. I
will try to write some code to do this, but I don't think I'll have a
chance to test it out this evening.

I think that the idea of common libraries is great - what I really want
to do is write a better search TAP (that can use mystuff extended info
data, will not record 2 copies of the same episode, etc), but so far
I've written an emulator, a UI library for displaying lists of things
and now spent time getting c++ working. Still, it's all good fun!
