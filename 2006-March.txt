Subject: [TAP-devel] Build errors in toolchain
Message-ID: <200603161046.29180.markb@users.berlios.de>

Hi,

I'm new to TAP development and have just joined this list.

I have tried to build the TAP toolchain but get errors and I am hoping
somebody here can help me. I am building the toolchain because I would
like to start experimenting with tap development but use C++ (I've read
all the appropriate posts here). However, the built-up toolchain
downloadable from the site has not been made with the
enable-languages=c,c++ option in the Makefile (although I see simonc
added it to the svn copy on 21-Dec-05).

I use a current Debian sid distribution which uses gcc v4.0.3 as the
default. One problem I immediately encountered were various compile
errors which I found were due to the toolchain requiring gcc v3. The
Makefile should probably specify this (or add the appropriate options on
gcc v4).

After this, the toolchain seems to build but fails in the taptest build
with the following:

Building taptest
make -C taptest
make[1]: Entering directory 
`/home/mark/Data/toppy/berlios/svn/trunk/tools/toolchain/taptest'
gcc-3.4 -nostartfiles -T /usr/local/topfield-gcc/mips/lib/tap.ld  
-Wl,-Map,menulibc.map -o menulibc.elf menulibc.o 
-L/usr/local/topfield-gcc/topfield-sdk/lib -ltap -lc -lm
/usr/bin/ld: target elf32-bigmips not found
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
make[1]: *** [menulibc.elf] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory 
`/home/mark/Data/toppy/berlios/svn/trunk/tools/toolchain/taptest'
make: *** [taptest/.built] Error 2

I have tried various hacks to overcome this without success. I think
that the target should now be something like elf32-tradbigmips
(traditional big mips)?

Does anybody know what the problem is? (note I get the same error if I
build the toolchain source download rather than the svn tree).

Regards,

Hi Mark,

didn't see this sort of problem when I built the toolchain for c++, but
mine is on Cygwin. I'm a bit suspicious that you've got a mixup going on
with your native toolchain (in /usr/bin) being used to compile for MIPS,
when actually your newly built tap toolchain should be doing that. I
presume you're running debian on x86, so I'm not surprised that
/usr/bin/ld can't cope with elf32-bigmips.

Try building one of the test taps from berlios and see if your toolchain
is actually OK. The binaries should have been built to
/usr/local/topfield-gcc.

Glad to hear that you're going to try c++ - keep us updated as to how
it's all going.

You mean a self-inflicted mixup? I just download the toolchain and type
make don't I? I haven't changed anything. The problem will likely be an
environment issue between my recent Debian (x86) and what the toolchain
expects and certainly cygwin will be quite different (in versions at
least) to my environment.

I already did some successfully so (I think?) my toolchain will build
all taps ok. However, I was looking for complete confidence by seeing
the toolchain make complete properly and the formal tap tests succeed. I
guess I will give up on this but a bug in the toolchain build does
exist.

BTW, regarding the svn tree. The make only succeeds for 8 of the 12 taps
and only libutils amongst the 6 libs. However, the errors are mostly due
to mistakes in the Makefiles, filename case errors, dos file names (e.g.
include .\tapstring), missing files, and plenty of other errors I can't
determine. Most of the source files have very odd line terminations (not
just a unix/dos issue), e.g. CRLF + LF (but not consistently in the same
file?). Do nearly all of the contributors here work on Windows and what
editors are they using? There are also directories in the libs area with
plenty of source files but no explanation of what the lib does or how to
build or use it.

Please don't take this comment harshly because this facility is a good
idea and has great potential. Clearly a number of people have gone to
enormous effort to set up and contribute to this community effort. These
(minor?) issues do make it onerous for a newbie however.

Hi Mark,

Sorry to hear you're having trouble. I'm afraid I can offer little help with
your toolchain problems. I had enough trouble getting the correct bits of
Cygwin up and running! Given the small number of people actively
contributing to Berlios, documentation has unfortunately not been a
priority. I'd hope that in this absence some of the TAPs might serve as a
starting point for new development. However, if they don't build we're going
to need a little help from you to sort it out. Obviously people wouldn't put
unbuildable code into svn on purpose so all the issues are likely to be due
to Windows v. Unix. Us Windows users just don't have any way of testing for
Unix compatibility unless someone knows otherwise. Do you have a list of the
TAPs that don't build and which files are causing problems? I've found
makefiles are like stepping back into the dark ages after using development
environments to manage builds for 11 years!

Simon
