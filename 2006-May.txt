Subject: [TAP-devel] Breaking changes to the c++ framework library
Message-ID: <4461AFD7.3060207@rattus.homelinux.com>

Just a heads up to anyone using the 'framework' UI library (anyone apart
from simonc?). I've checked in changes that reduce the widths of some
variables used when there is no point in them being 32 bits - for
example the height and width of windows on the UI is unlikely to need to
be more than 32000 pixels...:-) This was largely done in the hope that
fixing every compiler warning might lead me to an intermittent crash
that's in there somewhere (which it didn't), but compiling with no
warnings is good as it means you take notice of new ones that might be
important.

The most likely places that code using the library will need changing
are the following:

classes derived from ListItem that override DrawSubItem - the parameter
types have changed - if you don't update the derived class the custom
drawing code wont get called.

classes derived from Decorator - the parameter types on all the virtual
methods have changed, as above if you don't update the derived classes
then you'll get the base class implementation.

hope this doesn't cause too much pain.

Robin
