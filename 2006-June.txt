Subject: [TAP-devel] Linking problem
Message-ID: <20060603161148.19827.qmail@web35404.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Have successfully installed the Cygwin environment and can compile some of the sample apps - the ones that are effectively a single *.c file (maybe many but all #included into a single file). (BTW, some of the UK project apps have build errors, but I assume this is known).
  
To test linking, I'm trying to compile the Topfield fireclock. I've modified the skeleton Makefile but for some reason the linker is not being invoked. I get fire.o and clock.o created but they do not get linked into an elf, and so the tap isn't created. The relevant entries in the Makefile are: 
  
 fclk.elf:: fire.o clock.o  <- does this need ::? I've tried with just : too... 
 fire.o: fire.c 
 clock.o: clock.c 
  
Some of the taps included with the toolchain do seem to call the linker, but the Makefiles are much more complex. I've dug into the documentation a little, and think I understand what tap.mk does and can't see why the "elf" line above doesn't invoke the linker. 
  
 Can anyone suggest what might be the problem? 
  
 Thanks, Steve.

Hi Everyone,
 
I've recently been trying to build the C++ toolchain under Cygwin but always
get the same pattern of errors. The first and subsequence calls to Make give
this:
 
make[5]: Entering directory
`/home/Bruce/trunk/tools/toolchain/build-newlib/mips/soft-float/newlib'
make[5]: *** No rule to make target `all'.  Stop.
make[5]: Leaving directory
`/home/Bruce/trunk/tools/toolchain/build-newlib/mips/soft-float/newlib'
make[4]: *** [multi-do] Error 1

but if I then pipe the output to a file: make > out.txt it passes this error
but fails in build-gcc like this:
 
creating Makefile host.
*** Can only configure for one host and one target at a time.
Usage: configure [OPTIONS] [HOST]
 
and if you run again without the redirection it fails with this:
 
make[4]: Entering directory
`/home/Bruce/trunk/tools/toolchain/build-gcc/mips/soft-float/libiberty'
make[4]: *** No rule to make target `all'.  Stop.
make[4]: Leaving directory
`/home/Bruce/trunk/tools/toolchain/build-gcc/mips/soft-float/libiberty'
make[3]: *** [multi-do] Error 1

I've searched this archive and tried to trace the error but no joy.  Has
anyone seen this before?  If you have can you offer any advice?
 
Failing this, does anyone have a link for a prebuilt C++ toolchain?
 
Many Thx for any advice
 
Bruce
