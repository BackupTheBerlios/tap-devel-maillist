<PRE>Reply to all. I knew there had to be a way!

Mmmmm, C++. Yes please! I had limited success with the Topfield C++
compiler, the biggest problem being getting the TAP_PROGRAM_NAME macros
to be recognised.

C++ makes it somewhat easier to reuse components IMO. Mainly though I'd
rant about the following C 'features'
1. Having to do typedef struct _tagStructName { } StructName all over
the place
2  Variable declarations always at the top. Aaaaaarg. The number of
times I've bunged a TAP_Print in at the top of a function and then had
the compiler fall down.
3. No function overloading
4. No default parameters

If anyone is working on getting the C++ compiler working I'd be
extremely grateful just to get these 4 items! Given that we don't have
access to a full C standard library, I think that the lack of STL isn't
an issue.

Doxygen seems like a good idea. I've had a look at the doxygen site
<A HREF="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/index.html,">http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/index.html,</A> are you familiar with
using doxygen? Are there any quickstart commenting guides or crib sheets
for it?

Sounds fine to get the ball rolling. We can always improve things later.

Normally the convention is to use the above capitalisation for C++
classes. Given that a) there's not much C++ TAP code out there and b)
we're all unpaid volunteers, I won't play the code police. :-)

Good library documentation is important. Making use of Doxygen would be
nice, however I think that asking authors to learn the Doxygen
commenting style is probably going too far. I suspect that most
participants have never seen a lot of these industrial strength software
development tools and the learning curve is probably already pushing the
envelope. If you know Doxygen, or JavaDoc, please make use of it, but
don't lose sleep over it.

BTW: In order to reply to the mailing list, you should use &quot;Reply All&quot; 
instead of just &quot;Reply&quot;, otherwise the message will be a private reply,
sent only to the original poster.
