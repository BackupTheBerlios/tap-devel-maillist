<PRE>I found a few hours to try and get the C++ compiler working.

The Good News.
--------------
Building a C++ toolchain is easy. A couple of trivial changes in the 
toolchain Makefile is all that is required.

I have a simple C++ test program that compiles and runs without crashing 
the Toppy.

It's possible to write an entire TAP in a single C++ file. There's no 
need to put the Topfield TAP_ID, et. al. macros into a separate C file, 
which was apparently required with the original Topfield compiler.


The Bad News.
-------------
It looks like virtual functions don't work.

There is no default implementation of operator new or operator delete. 
Classes must implement these operators as calls to TAP_MemAlloc() and 
TAP_MemFree().

There is no implementation of the Standard C++ library.


The Verdict.
------------
If you are a C++ programmer and expect to make use of &quot;standard&quot; C++, 
you will be disappointed.
If you are a C programmer and would like a little bit of C++ syntactic 
sugar, this will do just fine.


Unless there is a lot of demand to have C++ support included as a 
standard feature in the toolchain, I won't be committing the C++ support 
very soon. It would require a new binary release of the toolchain, which 
is something I'd prefer not to do frivolously. Of course, I am happy to 
oblige if there *is* sufficient demand.

Cheers,

    Peter Urbanec
