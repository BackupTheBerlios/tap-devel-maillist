Subject: [TAP-devel] Use of srand(), rand()
Message-ID: <D395BFB7BC08B84987AC60473CFFD92D743269@readingex.reading.workplace-systems.plc.uk>

Hi guys,
 
When I call the srand() function 
 
e.g. srand(TAP_GetTick());
 
it crashes the Toppy. This function appears to work ok when compiled using
the original Topfield supplied gcc.
 
Anyone got any ideas as to why this would be?
 
Cheers,
 
Mark

If you wan't to work out how the compiler has broken it I'd suggest
creating a TAP that does this (and only this) in its tap main, compile
it both ways and run 'mips-objdump -d' (dissassemble) on the .elf files
and see how they differ. I'd guess the problem lies in the
implementation of srand in libc, not in the call to it. I'd even go so
far as to speculate that it might be an integer overflow exception (MIPS
has 2 types of arithmetic functions, one sort throws exceptions on
overflow and the other doesnt - maybe the new compiler is using the
wrong one?).

If you just want random numbers, don't worry about srand(), just call
rand() and xor the results with something like the current MJD and the
current tick count. Alternatively you can probably find rand/srand
implementations on the web and try coding your own to see if that fares
any better.

ps - list moderators, please ignore the identical post to this that I
sent from the wrong address (again...) I really must stop doing that :-(

Cheers for the info Robin,
 
Not sure I am up to disassembling the code, but I think I will follow your
suggestion of finding alternate random generation instead. Unfortunately
using rand() on its own also causes a crash.
